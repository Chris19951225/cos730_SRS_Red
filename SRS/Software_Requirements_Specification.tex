	\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Purpose}
    The software requirements speciÔ¨Åcation (SRS) will appropriately outline the functional requirements of the Benchmarking system to ensure that an external party, such as designers, developers and clients, could develop the functionality to a required degree without further instruction. Hence, the functional requirements should be precise and extensive to eliminate deviation from the goals of the system. 
	\subsection{Scope}
    The Benchmarking system is a web based application designed to enable performance profiling by providing hardware and hardware monitoring capabilities, then storing and reporting the findings for each service request. The system will monitor and report CPU usage, memory usage, power consumption, heat generation, elapsed time and network usage. The system will be able to provide hardware to run benchmarking requests and will be able to accept hardware that the user provides themselves. The system will minimize side effects that are not a concern of the benchmarking requests. The system will accept user code that may come in different programming languages, confirm its runnable and execute it to generate profiling information. The system will not optimize the code nor correct it. Through using the Benchmarking system, users will be able to see the efficiency of their provided code and how it will run on specific infrastructure. The system will also provide administrative capabilities for specific users, allowing them to manage other users and view their activities.

	\subsection{Overview}
	The SRS will help give a detailed representation of the functional requirements and how the sub-elements of the system interact with one another to achieve the Benchmarking system's purpose.

	\section{Overall Description}
    	
	\subsection{Product Perspective}
    The main system will be a server on the University of Pretoria (UP) campus and will be connected to a database that stores profiling information of previously executed benchmarking requests. Users will log on to the web-based application through a browser and provide code to the Benchmarking system. They will then be able to choose between providing their own hardware for monitoring or use existing hardware provided by the system. They then have to choose which attributes are to be monitored. They will then execute the benchmarking request and view it real-time and/or view the profiling report generated at the end of the benchmarking request. Hence users will be able to view their code's performance and how it compares to other versions or other code. Administrative users will be able to log on to the Benchmarking system and view the activities of non-managerial users, as well as manage their accounts.   
	\subsection{Product Function}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        		\item The service will enable code and/or hardware based performance profiling for given code samples or executables 
                \item The system will provide profiling information real-time and post benchmark request execution
                \item The system will provide access to profiling information of previously run benchmarking requests
                \item The system will allow administrative users to manage existing normal users and the system itself 
              	\item The system will allow users to provide their own hardware for benchmarking requests 
                \item The system will allow users to export and/or share profiling information
                \item The system will allow users to choose hardware specifications for each benchmarking request
    \end{itemize}
    
	\subsection{User Characteristics}
     \begin{itemize}       		
                \item Hardware seeking users: These are your average users. They will have a basic knowledge of computers and computer hardware. These will be the users that provide code and use existing hardware provided by the Benchmarking system. They will have normal user privileges, thus have control only over their own account. 
                \item Hardware providing users: These users have a higher knowledge of computers and computer hardware than the usual hardware seeking user. These will be the users that provide their own hardware for benchmarking requests. They will have normal user privileges, thus have control only over their own account. 
                \item Managerial users: These are users with elevated account privileges. They have managerial skills and a basic knowledge of computers and computer hardware. Managerial users will be able to monitor normal user activities as well as manage existing normal user accounts.
                \item Administrator: These are back-end users. They have access to the Benchmarking system's existing hardware as well managerial capabilities over existing normal and managerial users. They have expert knowledge of computers and computer hardware. They have full control over system resources. 
    \end{itemize}
	\subsection{Constraints}
    This section elaborates on the limitations of the options that are available when developing the Benchmarking system 
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item The system is a web-based application and therefore must run on a device that has browser support. 
        \item The system runs on a remote server therefore an internet connection is required in order to communicate with the Benchmarking system. 
        \item The system may not report real-time accurately, depending on the network connection strength.
        \item The system's profiling report information is limited by the existing hardware in the system as it can not provide information for hardware it can not monitor.
    \end{itemize}
	\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
	All assumptions relate to the user and the device they are using. It is assumed that the user seeking to use the Benchmarking system has basic knowledge of how to use an IT device with browser support. It is assumed that the device the user is using has browser support and can connect to the internet.
